# Welcome, explorer!

It's been a month since you entered the jungle. You've braved mosquitos, malaria, jaguars that scream at you from trees, mysterious rustles from the dark corners of the tangled underbrush, spiders, snakes, and drenching downpours. All because of vague rumors of a mysterious ancient site hidden deep in the uncharted forest. Finding it would make your career as an archaeologist.

Finally, your search has proven fruitful: you are standing on the south side of a large pyramid. But what is this temple?

It's probably time to open your backpack to get the gear you need to start exploring.
