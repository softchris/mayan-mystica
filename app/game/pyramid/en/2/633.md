# Numbers

You approach the unbolted door, and find a code. You consult your guidebook, but it only contains a ripped page. One part of the page contains one clue: "Roman Numeral 5" and the other contains a code: "[- · · ·](https://maya.nmai.si.edu/maya-sun/maya-math-game)".

There is a [URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-nodejs/2-what/?WT.mc_id=mayamystery-playfab-jelooper) and a phrase: "Node's JavaScript engine".
