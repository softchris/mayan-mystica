# Come back in September!

Congratulations, you have discovered the second of three parts of the temple's name, and learned about new glyphs. You have also helped restore the temple. Well done!

Come back in September and ascend to the top of the pyramid. Learn its name, the goddess to whom it is dedicated, and more!
