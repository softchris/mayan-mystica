# Diving Deep

Looking down, you shiver when thinking of the cold, deep water.

You are completely unequipped to dive into this cenote. Maybe you should order some specialized gear online.

Due to your choppy cell signal, your regular shops seem to be out of reach. But there's one resource that seems to be online: GitHub!

A quick search reveals an unfinished shopping cart experience. If you can checkout the proper gear, you will be able to dive into the cenote to recover the missing stone.

Clone [this GitHub repo of a Node.js-based store](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Azure-Maya-Mystery-Challenge-2) and follow the instructions on the README to complete the shopping cart experience, get your gear, and enter your secret code in the box below.
