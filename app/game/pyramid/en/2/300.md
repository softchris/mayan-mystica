# Welcome back!

You hear a rumbling in the distance and realize the stairs leading to the door that just opened have become smooth as a slide. Your shins scrape against damp walls as you slide down what seems to be an endless ramp. Finally you skid to a stop.

It is completely dark.

You grope in your backpack to find your flashlight, but its light is feeble against the profound darkness.

You feel a tickle on your ankle.
