# A Message

What seemed to be a stone is actually alive! 

A long neck emerges from a rock-like shell, and two ancient eyes look up at you. It seems you have disturbed a turtle.

"Hello, stranger", the creature says. "Be careful here. Didn't you hear the water? You're standing in a dangerous spot."

The glow from the turtle's shell illuminates the underground cavern, and you see that, a few inches from your feet, a sheer precipice drops down to an underground lake. You almost fell into a cenote.

"You are welcome to explore here if you leave the pyramid in better shape than you found it. If you can dive into the cenote and retrieve a missing piece of this chamber, I'll allow you to continue your quest to the summit."
