# The Summit

You follow the path of the sunbeam dancing through the room to a staircase, which leads up to the summit of the pyramid.

A voice echoes behind you: "Now you can claim your reward, adventurer! I understand your kind find these to be pretty, so I created one for you."

You look up over the trees and see a dazzling rainbow, the emblem of the great rainbow herself, Chak Chel.

Congratulations! You have attained the summit of the pyramid, and solved the Azure Maya Mystery!
