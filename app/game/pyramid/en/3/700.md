# A Bookish Clue

Although your guidebook hasn't been very helpful up to now, you open it as prompted and discover a note that says, "Sort all glyphs into their appropriate...k-nearest-neighbor"

Appropriate what? And what is this about neighbors? The guidebook includes a picture of yet another glyph.

<Item id="15" />

<Page url="599" instructions="You click on the URL that appears next to the glyph's image to learn more about these neighbors and their sorting. It seems that you need to rearrange the broken glyphs on the frieze according to their 'house'." action="Continue" condition="15" />
