# Up the Stairs

You've come a long way. So far, you have gained entry into the pyramid by solving a code. Then you slid down to the bottom of the edifice, discovered a cenote, dove underwater to retrieve broken glyphs, and restored them to their proper place.

A shaft of light over the cenote reveals a staircase going up.
