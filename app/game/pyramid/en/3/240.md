# The Main Chamber

Climbing the flight of stairs, you discover the inner sanctum of the pyramid, its main chamber.

On the wall is a frieze with several missing pieces.

You look through the rubble on the floor to see if any clues exist to fit the glyphs back into the empty niches. Clearly this chamber has been visited before and the floor is littered with stone shards.

One stone, however, stands out. It is inscribed with complicated carvings.

<Item id="14" />
