# The Last Test

"You have discovered the name of my temple, and now you know who I am as well. You have done very well! As a reward, I will allow you to access the summit of the pyramid. But first, you must decipher one more glyph."

A shaft of light bounces around the room, coming to rest on a glyph you hadn't noticed before. There is some graffiti next to the glyph with the word, 'Hex' and some codes:

#ff0000, #ffa500, #ffff00, #008000, #0000ff, #4b0082, #ee82ee.
