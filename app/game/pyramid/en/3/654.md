# Niches

As you restore the glyphs to their proper place, the third, still empty niche begins to glow an eerie red color.

Looking closer, you notice the images of the aged woman with the snake headdress and water jar start to move.

The lady's eye rolls toward you, and a creaky voice speaks: "You have done well to restore my pyramid, and I am not ungrateful! In return, I will allow you to learn the name of my temple, and who I am. My name is Chak Chel, and I am the goddess of both creation and destruction. The spiders that you met before near my sacred cenote are my special weaver emissaries."

"I have one more task for you before you can ascend the summit and claim your reward. You must discover the name of this temple to complete the restoration."
