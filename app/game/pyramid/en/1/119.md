# Missing Stones

Noticing that the markings on the wall also have stones missing underneath the inscriptions, you guess that you should match the meaning of the glyphs to the marking on the wall. Your guidebook tells you that jaguars belong to the 'cat' family, and macaws are an endangered species in the wild. The URL associated to each of the glyphs might help.
